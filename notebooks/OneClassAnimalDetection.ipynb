    "# One-Class SVM for Animal Detection (When Only Animal Images are Available)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to detect if an image contains an animal, **without** having any non-animal training images. We use a **One-Class SVM**, which learns what “normal” (in this case, *animal*) looks like, and flags anything else as an outlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Points\n",
    "1. **No non-animal data**: We cannot do a standard supervised (binary) classification. We only have *animal* images.\n",
    "2. **One-Class SVM**: This approach allows us to treat animal images as our \"normal\" class. At prediction time, if a new image deviates significantly from what the model learned, it's flagged as \"Non-Animal.\"\n",
    "3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: We do a simple grid search over parameters like `nu` and `gamma` to find a good fit for our animal data.\n",
    "4. **Same Function Names**: The required functions are `load_images`, `train_animal_classifier`, and `predict_image`.\n"

    "## How It Works\n",
    "1. **Load & Preprocess**: Converts images to grayscale, resizes them to 64×64, and flattens them into 1D arrays.\n",
    "2. **Train/Validation Split**: Splits the available *animal* images into train (80%) and validation (20%).\n",
    "3. **One-Class SVM**: The model learns a decision boundary around your *animal* data. Anything that deviates significantly is labeled as \"-1\" (outlier).\n",
    "4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: We do a simple loop over a small grid of `(nu, gamma)` values:\n",
    "   - `nu` controls the fraction of outliers allowed in the training set.\n",
    "   - `gamma` is the kernel coefficient for the RBF kernel.\n",
    "   - We pick the combination that yields the **fewest** outliers on the validation set.\n",
    "5. **Prediction**: `predict_image` loads a new image and runs the trained One-Class SVM. The result is either +1 (\"Animal\") or -1 (\"Non-Animal\").\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Important**: Because we have no real non-animal data for training or testing, we cannot measure the false positive rate (i.e., how often it labels a non-animal as \"Animal\"). If you gather non-animal images later, you can check how well the model rejects them."

    "## Next Steps\n",
    "- **Collect Non-Animal Data**: If you ever get actual negative (non-animal) images, you can:\n",
    "  1. Check how often they're classified incorrectly.\n",
    "  2. Possibly switch to a **binary classifier** (like an SVM or deep net) that trains on both animal and non-animal examples.\n",
    "- **Feature Extraction**: Instead of raw pixels, you could consider using more advanced features (e.g., HOG, color histograms, or even deep features) if your images vary widely in lighting, angles, etc.\n",
    "- **Tune Further**: If you have many images, you might expand the hyperparameter search or use a tool like `GridSearchCV` (though it typically expects a labeled dataset)."
